        <p>SCENE III.--BÃ‰LISE (_entering softly and listening_), CHRYSALE,
            ARISTE.
            
            <h6>ARI.</h6> <p class ="ari"> Clitandre has chosen me to be his interpreter to you; he has
            fallen in love with Henriette.</p>
            
            <h6>CHRY.</h6> <p class = "chry">What! with my daughter?</p>
            
            <h6>ARI.</h6> <p class = "ari">Yes. Clitandre is delighted with her, and you never saw a lover
            so smitten!</p>
            
            <h6>BEL.(_to_ ARISTE). </h6><p id = "bel">No, no; you are mistaken. You do not know the
            story, and the thing is not as you imagine.</p>
            
            <h6>ARI.</h6> <p class = "ari">How so, sister?</p>
            
            <h6>BEL.</h6> <p class = "bel">Clitandre deceives you; it is with another that he is in love.</p>
            
            <h6>ARI.</h6> <p class = "ari">It is not with Henriette that he is in love? You are joking.</p>
            
            <h6>BEL.</h6> <p class = "bel">No; I am telling the perfect truth.</p>
